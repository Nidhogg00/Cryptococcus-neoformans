This repository contains the code and data used in the study "Machine Learning Prediction of GAT201-Regulated Gene Expression in Cryptococcus neoformans This repository contains the code and data used in the study "Machine Learning Prediction of GAT201-Regulated Gene Expression in Cryptococcus neoformans Using Minimal Motifs". The repository is organized into the following folders and files:

Code Folder:

Contains all the scripts and programs developed and utilized during the research. These codes facilitate data analysis, model training, and prediction tasks as described in the study.
Data Folder:

Includes all the datasets used in the research. The key files are:
Gat201_samplesheet.csv: Details the experimental design, outlining the conditions and samples used in the experiments.
counts_all.csv: Provides gene expression data, representing the expression levels of each gene under various conditions.
H99_all_genes_promoter_500nt_2mer_counts.csv
H99_all_genes_promoter_500nt_3mer_counts.csv
H99_all_genes_promoter_500nt_4mer_counts.csv
H99_all_genes_promoter_500nt_5mer_counts.csv: These files contain counts of motifs (2-mers, 3-mers, 4-mers, and 5-mers) present in the promoter sequences (500 nucleotides upstream) of each gene.
All the data included in this repository are sourced from the experiments conducted by Hughes et al. These datasets provide a comprehensive foundation for analyzing the regulatory impact of the transcription factor GAT201 on gene expression in Cryptococcus neoformans. By leveraging minimal motifs through machine learning techniques, this study aims to accurately predict gene expression patterns influenced by GAT201.
